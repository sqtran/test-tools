# test-tools

This is just a collection of scripts I used when testing/debugging things.

These only deploy to an `OpenShift` Environment, which is hosted on `opentlc`.  You'd have to make some changes if you decide to reuse any of these scripts, but I don't know why you would though.  If anything, just use these as examples.
